# Causal Inference :balance_scale: :mag:

Welcome to the Causal Inference section of ML_LAB! In this repository, we aim to explore the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. We delve into different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied in the domain of causal inference.

## Contents :file_folder:

1. **Machine Learning Algorithms** :gear:

   - Dive into implementations of various machine learning algorithms. Understand their inner workings and how they can be adapted for causal inference.

2. **Application to Causal Inference** :arrows_counterclockwise:

   - Explore how machine learning can be used to understand cause-and-effect relationships. We'll examine real-world examples and work on translating data into insights.

3. **Code Snippets and Tutorials** :computer:
   - Find practical code snippets and detailed tutorials to help you understand the application of machine learning in causal inference.

## Getting Started :rocket:

To start exploring, feel free to browse through the files in the repository. Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder, complete with code and a README to guide you through the process.

## Contributions :handshake:
